Prime Factors
=============

This program has two types of input, user and file. Switching between the two modes is done by commenting out lines within the program.

When given a number, such as 24, the program will output

24: 2 x 2 x 2 x 3

or if given 7 the output will be

7: Prime

For file input, multiple numbers can be given on new lines and the output will include prime factorizations of all the numbers. Example input and output for numbers 1 to 10,000 are given.

Due to the way primes are detected, 1 will give an output of prime despite it technically being neither prime nor composite.
